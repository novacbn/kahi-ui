# Icons

By default the Kahi UI **DOES NOT** ship with Icons, although it **DOES** support inserting Icons at key-locations or make it possible to insert your own. Here are some suggestions of Icon libraries that have been known to work well with the Framework:

-   [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) — Lightweight SVG Icons, used by this documentation site.

    -   [`novacbn/svelte-feather`](https://novacbn.github.io/svelte-feather) — Svelte bindings for Feather, also used by this documentation site. _(disclaimer: made by me)_
